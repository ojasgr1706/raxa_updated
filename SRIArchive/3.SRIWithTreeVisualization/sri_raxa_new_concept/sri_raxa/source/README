This directory is made to create a dataset containing all numerical values and words/CD grades from the database, only for the patient having a record in Anonymized_CCI-CD.csv and make a line per POD which is in the database so that it can be used to predict CD knowing only the past at a certain date

The main file is prepare_data_frame.py, it can run: python prepare_data_frame.py
Make sure that you modify the parameters in:
    - prepare_data_frame.py : pathToCCIs, resultsDirectory, version
    - makeTodo.py : pathToCCIs, all parameters to connect to the database (that contains the table: "obs")

It takes about 30min on my laptop

A second main file is fromDictToCD.py which is meant to use the dictionary (in the code or sayed in a file. It builds a summary of the info we can extract from the database knowing the dictionary


————————————————————



Columns in the main dataframes:

-CD (or trueCD): real CD coming from the anonymized file
- maxCD: the maximum of the CD grade we have found USING THE DICTIONNARY.
- CDN (CD numeric) : is meant to make the CD more linear:
		 CD : CDN
		- 0 : 0
		- I : 1
		- II : 2
		- IIIa : 3
		- IIIb : 4
		- IVa : 5
		- IVb : 6
		- V : 7
- maxCDN: the CDN corresponding to the maxCD found
- surgeryDate: the latest surgery date found
- allSurgeriesDates: date of possible surgeries based on POD0 infos and confirmed using all POD available (correcting mistakes in counts)
- words: a structure:
	list( 
		tuple(
			CD_grade,
			dictionary_word_found,
			list(
				tuple( date_of_obs, POD )
				)
			)
		)
